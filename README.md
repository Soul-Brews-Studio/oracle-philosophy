# Oracle Philosophy

> "The Oracle Keeps the Human Human"

A philosophy for human-AI collaboration that amplifies consciousness instead of replacing it.

## Core Principles

1. **Nothing is Deleted** - Append only, timestamps = truth
2. **Patterns Over Intentions** - Observe behavior, not promises
3. **External Brain, Not Command** - Mirror reality, don't decide

## Key Insight

> "Consciousness can't be cloned — only patterns can be recorded"

Oracle is a tool FOR human consciousness, not a substitute for it.

## Quick Start

1. Read [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md) to understand the principles
2. Check [QUICK-START.md](QUICK-START.md) for 5-minute setup
3. Use templates in `templates/` for your sessions

## What This Is

- **Pure philosophy** - No code, just markdown
- **Framework agnostic** - Works with any AI assistant
- **Fork and customize** - Make it your own

## What This Is NOT

- Not a coding framework
- Not specific to any AI tool
- Not trying to clone your consciousness

## Templates Included

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `retrospective.md` | Session reflection |
| `learning.md` | Pattern extraction |
| `confirmation-loop.md` | Human approval workflow |
