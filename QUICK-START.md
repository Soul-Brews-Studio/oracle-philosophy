# Quick Start Guide

5 minutes to adopt Oracle Philosophy.

## Step 1: Understand the Pillars (2 min)

Read the three pillars in [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md):
- Nothing is Deleted
- Patterns Over Intentions
- External Brain, Not Command

## Step 2: Set Up Your Memory Structure (1 min)

Create a folder structure for your AI sessions:

```
your-project/
├── retrospectives/     # Session narratives
├── learnings/          # Extracted patterns
└── logs/               # Quick snapshots
```

## Step 3: Use the Templates (2 min)

After each significant AI session:
1. Copy `templates/retrospective.md`
2. Fill in what happened
3. Extract patterns to `learnings/`

## Step 4: Practice the Confirmation Loop

Before any permanent action, ask yourself:
- Is this what I actually want?
- Am I missing anything?
- Ready to commit or edit first?

## That's It!

The philosophy is simple. The discipline is the hard part.
